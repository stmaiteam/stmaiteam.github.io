Keyword  extraction  is  a  natural  language  proces-sing task that enables the extraction of essential and descriptivewords  in  the  text.  The  task  of  extracting  keywords  from  well-structured  texts  has  been  studied  extensively  in  the  literature.However,   because   of   the   difference   in   the   structures   of   thegathered data from the websites and the difficulty of this process,there is a lack of studies in this field. In this study, data from thewebsites  of  25  large  Turkish  companies  operating  in  Turkey  iscollected, and keywords related to these companies are extracted.In  the  proposed  deep  learning-based  model,  Sentence-BERT,  aBERT-based  method  that  has  recently  yielded  quite  successfulresults  in  natural  language  processing,  is  used.  To  evaluate  theperformance  of  the  proposed  method,  the  data  is  annotatedwith  human  effort  and  the  impressive  results  are  shared  withthe  reader.  In  addition,  clues  about  the  companies’  businessdomains  are  tried  to  be  detected  by  clustering  the  companies’keywords.
